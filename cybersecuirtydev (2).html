<h3><u>What is cyber secuity</u></h3>
 <p> Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

 <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
 <p>Theft is not often done in the traditional sense anymore, for example bank holdups are not so common. The threat vector has now changed theft is now via the internet using different and effective methods. The WannaCry ransomware last October (2017) is very famous where the NHS staff had their access to their very important and confidential data blocked by someone asking for a ransom to get their own data back. Some governments suggest that this could have been a Nation-state or a government backed group that carried this attack out. </p>

 <p>Ransomware is now considered one of the biggest cyber threats in play today. However, it is not the only cyber threat in existence, there are many other cyber risks including Malware attacks, Phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Criminals will always be finding different and more sophisticated ways of using technology to their advantage whether that be for financial gain, cyber-terror or revenge. </p>
     <P>A good knowledge of security both from a foundation level to an advanced level is essential.  The surprising thing is, that none of the topic areas in this essay are very complex, they are things that a person or organisation should be commonly doing. A business that is able to protect its data will almost certainly be able to focus on the business side of things and make money. Government departments will be able to keep data private and secure and military operations will not be hacked and released to other foreign malicious governments and terrorist organisations. This will keep our country safe and secure. </P>

 <div id="Asset Security">
    <h2><u>Asset Security</u></h2>
 <p>An asset is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities and is probably the most important thing that gives a business its value, this can also be something intangible like reputation, Intellectual property etc. Loss of an asset can cause a business to suffer financial, reputational or competitive losses. Securing assets becomes extremely when understanding that the asset is what gives the business its value. Too often organisations misunderstand the importance of an asset until it is too late and the damage has been done. </p>

     <h3><b>Managing Risk</b></h3>
     <p> When we talk about risk management in cyber security, we generally mean the evaluation of different risks together with procedures to minimise the impact and loss to the business. Risk can be managed in a number of ways, however, there is one main and common method of managing risk. Transferring of a risk to another e.g. insurance. The whole point of insurance is to lower the risk of loss (quite often financial) although recovering from a loss may take a while due to various processes. It can be quite costly to have insurance and so the right balance must be understood as to the value of the asset vs the cost of insuring that item. For example, a Cisco router costs £2000 the risk factor is possibly 2 x per year. However, the insurance costs £6000 per year. In this scenario it doesn’t make sense to insure this asset and you may decide to accept the risk associated with this asset. </p>

<div id="Cryptography">
 <h2><u>Cryptography/Encryption</u></h2>
  <h3>What is Cryptography</h3>
   <p>Cryptography is the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets.
   Cryptography began thousands of years ago. To encrypt and decrypt a message both the sender and the recipient need to know the secret key.
   There is a form of encryption called asymmetric (logical or mathematical relation) encryption where there are two keys, one for encrypting messages and a different one for decrypting them.
	</p>
	<h3>The Goals Of Cybersecurity</h3>
	<p>The main reason why cryptography is used is so the information stored on that document is confidential.
	The fact that the information is ciphered means that anyone who has access to the information will not understand the information on the document.
	The application of cryptography most often than not will apply to data in the following states: Data at Rest, Data in Motion and Data In Use</p>
<h3>Data In Motion</h3>
<p> Data in transit or data in motion is that data that is actively moving from one location to another whether that be across the internet or through a private network. Data protection in transit is the protection of data as it traverses from network to network or from one storage location to another.
Data in transit if often is less secure (example of man in the middle in the attack) whilst in motion. The frequent choice of protecting this sort of data is done either by encrypting data prior to moving and/or using encrypted connections (HTTPS, SSL, TLS, FTPS etc.)</p>
<h3>Data In Use</h3>
<p>Data in use is often used as a complement to the above two types of data. Data in use is referred to data that is being used by one or more applications. This can be data that is in the process of being generated, updated, appended or erased. Similar to Data in transit, this type of data can be a challenge to protect due its state of needing to be often unencrypted and available to those that require use of it. </p>
<h3>Data At Rest</h3>
<p>Data at rest is data that is not actively moving on the network or from device to device. Examples of such data include data residing on a hard drive, flash drive and other such storage devices. Although this type of data is less vulnerable than data in motion, this type of data is considered a more valuable target.
Protection of data at rest is simply by encrypting files prior to storage or encrypting the actual storage media. </p>
<h3>Nationwide Case study</h3>
<p>A Nationwide trusted employee had taken his laptop home which contained unencrypted Personal Identifiable Information (PII).
The laptop owner had gone abroad on holiday and left his laptop unattended at home. A burglar had broken into his house and stolen the laptop along with other belongings.
<br><br>
 Although the burglar may not have been that interested in the contents of the laptop, due to it being stolen and being accessible meant that 11 million peoples personal data was now at risk. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) eventually fined Nationwide £980,000, still the largest sum ever imposed for data loss in the UK, seen at the time as a warning shot for other firms that might have similar incidents. </p>
<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>
<p>One of the obvious lessons we can learn from this is that whenever you are storing personal data, encryption is an important factor. The reason for this is that a business needs to protect the data of its customer. PII refers to any sort of data that can identity a specific person.
<br><br>Another important factor that links in with this case study is related to asset security. Had the laptop been secured properly the theft could have been prevented. For example, locking the laptop away at work whilst on holiday. In addition, the employee should have been using hard drive encryption like BitLocker this would encrypt the whole hard drive when not in use. </p>

<div id="GDPR">
<h2>EU General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
<p>GDPR is a regulation that was implemented on the 25th May 2018 through which the European Parliament, Council of the European Union and the European Commission intend to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals within the EU.
<br>It also addresses the export of personal data outside of the EU. The main objectives of the GDPR are to pass control back to the people over their personal data. The regulation was adopted on the 27th April 2016 and will become enforceable on its implementation data (25th May 2018). This will be the biggest change in data privacy for over 20 years and so, anyone wishing to trade with EU businesses MUST be GDPR compliant. </p>
<p>The two key reasons that make GDPR so important are:</p>
<ol>
<li>GDPR will apply to most organisations, even those not based in Europe because it mandates certain protections and provisions for any organisation that controls or processes the personal data on any EU resident.</li>
<li>The penalty for non-compliance can be up to €20 million or 4% of the total annual global turnover (based on previous financial year) whichever is greater.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Data Encryption in relation to GDPR</h3>
<p>Of the few technologies that are mentioned in the GDPR, encryption is suggesting a number of times within the regulation wording and this would apply to data whether it be at rest, in use or in transit. In short, with the introduction of GDPR, encryption and other security measures are established as data protection organisations are expected to adhere or face the consequences. </p>
,<p>Aside from fines, GDPR will introduce a name and shame mechanism whereby non-compliant businesses will have to notify the data protection authority of any security breach that affects the confidentiality, integrity or security of the personal data that is held. Furthermore, if the breach will result in identity theft, fraud, financial loss or other significant economic or social disadvantages then data subject must also be informed. However, if prior to the breach the data was rendered unintelligible, for example through encryption, businesses will not have to notify the data subjects of the breach.  </p>
<p> Encryption may be just the thing that may save businesses from public damnation. It is expected over the coming years that pseudonymisation and data encryption will become standard best practices in Europe and beyond.</p>

<div id="Network Security">
<h2>Network Security</h2>
<br>
<h3>What is Network Security</h3>
<p>Communication and Network security is a term that describes the policies and practices adopted to prevent and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and network-accessible resources.</p>
<h3>Firewall</h3>
<p> One of the ways in which we can help to protect our own network is by installing a firewall. A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. There are 2 types of firewall: a hardware and a software version. A hardware firewall is generally built into a router or a stand-alone/separate device. A software firewall is downloaded and installed from the internet legally. Some examples are Kaspersky or Comodo Free Firewall etc.</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of hardware firewall</h3>
<p> One of the advantages of a hardware firewall is that it is quite fast in terms of its response rate. This means that it can handle a lot of network traffic. Another advantage to the hardware firewall is that it is less prone for attacks as hardware firewalls have enhanced security controls. This in turn reduces the risk the security risk. On the other hand, the disadvantage of a hardware firewall is that it can be spacious and requires wiring as it is designed to be a stand-alone/separate device.</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of software firewall </h3>
<p>One of the advantages of a software wall is that it is very cheap or even sometimes free as there are many software firewall downloads available online on the internet. Another advantage is that it is very easy to configure as majority of the changes in the system are down via updates. On the other hand, there are some downsides to the software firewall. One of the disadvantages of a software wall is that it cannot handle a lot of network traffic as it tends to have a slow response rate. This would make it easier for hackers to penetrate to the software firewall system. Another disadvantage is that the software firewalls can take up a lot of storage space on your device. The impact of this is that it can overall slow down your device. </p>
<h3>Which Firewall is better</h3>
<p> Based on the advantages and disadvantages that have been mentioned for the 2 different firewalls we can clearly see that different people will need different firewalls. Firstly, if you are the working or managing a popular and well-known business, then your most likely to have a hardware firewall. One of the reasons for this is that you are very prone to have a person trying to hack into your system than an ordinary household person. This is because people are aware of your financial success and will try to hack you for financial benefits. </p>
<h3>IDS & IPS Firewall</h3>
<p>An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device (hardware) or software application (software) that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity. Any malicious activity is instantly noted/alerted to the user via an event management system. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security/threat prevention technology that examines network traffic flows to detect and prevent any malicious actions. You can also get an IPS in the form of a hardware or software. The simple difference between the two is that IDS detects but takes no action, whilst an IPS takes a preventative action. </p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p> In April 2011, Sony revealed that the PSN (PlayStation network), which is used by millions of people, has been attacked by hackers. The breach went unnoticed for several days which resulted into the hackers stealing person information and customer records from 70 million people. Customer records- DOB, name, address, passwords, emails. These information's could be adapted and used for additional attacks such as identity thief or ransomware. In response to this, Sony took the PSN offline which was a move that costed the company. Sony was eventually fined by the information commissions office as result of breaching the data protection act.
<br><br>
How the security breach was made successful to the hackers was that there was a weakness in Sony’s network which they were not alerted about. This was known as an external intrusion. This ultimately led to the hackers being successful and stealing personal data from 77 million accounts. Investigators have discovered that the cause of the security breach was due to security flaw in their system which led to an external intrusion.
<br><br>
After the security breach Sony had welcomed back their PSN member and as compensation had promised PSN members 30 days free membership for PlayStation plus.
<h3>Lesson Learned</h3>
<p> Linking back to the main question, we can clearly see that there are many areas of improvement that Sony can focus on in order to prevent such data loss. One of the things that Sony could is to install an IPS and IDS. A good IPS rather than an IDS may have recognised the hackers traffic and stopped it before and further damage good have been done. Furthermore, a good firewall would have prevented and blocked the traffic even before that connection was made. Also, Sony could have used both a software and hardware firewalls. Sony being a very successful company could have bought and owned a hardware firewall. The software wall could be used as a backup in case there is some form of malfunction in the hardware firewall. </p>

<div id="Cloud Computing">
<h2>Cloud Computing/Security</h2>
<h3>What is Cloud Computing</h3>
<p> Cloud computing in its simplest form is a way to utilise or outsource network related services through the use of the internet. Although Cloud computing is a fairly new term, the backend technology has been around for quite some time. Simple examples of cloud computing are things like using email as online storage, online gaming, Dropbox storage, Evernote creation and many other different services. Organisations will consider cloud either for a financial benefit (i.e. not wanting purchase hardware, software etc) or due to elasticity. Elasticity can be explained using an example of Black Friday sales. A business normally has 100 customers per day, and it expects up to a 1000 on black Friday. It wouldn’t make sense to buy 10 x new hardware to cover business need for just one or two days. The cloud offering would be able to meet this need through elasticity by allowing enough compute and storage to meet the business demand.</p>
<h3>There are 3 main types of cloud service offerings:</h3>
<h4>IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)</h4>
<p>This is where a customer is renting the barebone computing hardware from the cloud provider. The Platform (i.e. operating System), software and data are all the customer’s responsibility. Examples of platforms are; Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft’ Azure platform. </p>
<h4>PaaS (Platform as a Service)</h4>
<p>The next level up is the Platform as a Service. This is where the cloud provider provides not only the barebone hardware but also a platform to develop and put applications on to. </p>
<h4>SaaS (Software as a Service)</h4>
<p> The final offering is Software as a Service, this is where the cloud provider is responsible for the infrastructure, platform and software. Examples are Google apps (like Google Calendar), Dropbox etc.</p>
<h3>Why are Security Considerations for the Cloud Important</h3>
<p>
From an enterprise perspective, transferring or outsourcing important data to a cloud provider needs more consideration than just the financial benefits of migrating to the cloud. Most companies are now migrating their data into the cloud. However, it may sound like the sensible option but people need to need consider a few things when migrating their data to the cloud.
<br><br>
Firstly, one of the main reasons why migration should happen is to ensure availability of data when required. Cloud providers generally invest a lot more in their infrastructure and so you can be sure that your data will be backed up in different places to ensure availability and to help recover from any business disaster (for example a fire).
<br><br>
The second thing is that you need to consider is the level of security the cloud company has. If it is less secure than your company then the obvious thing to do is to not use their cloud service. For example, a cloud provider may have great encryption on their data and encrypted data links. However, if the actual datacentre is unprotected and prone to physical attacks, then the physical devices holding the data could be stolen. At that point encryption does nothing to help you get your data back.
