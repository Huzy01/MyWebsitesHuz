<h3><u>What is cyber secuity</u></h3>
 <p> Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.

 <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
 <p>Theft is not often done in the traditional sense anymore, for example bank holdups are not so common. The threat vector has now changed theft is now via the internet using different and effective methods. The WannaCry ransomware last October (2017) is very famous where the NHS staff had their access to their very important and confidential data blocked by someone asking for a ransom to get their own data back. Some governments suggest that this could have been a Nation-state or a government backed group that carried this attack out. </p>

 <p>Ransomware is now considered one of the biggest cyber threats in play today. However, it is not the only cyber threat in existence, there are many other cyber risks including Malware attacks, Phishing and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Criminals will always be finding different and more sophisticated ways of using technology to their advantage whether that be for financial gain, cyber-terror or revenge. </p>
     <P>A good knowledge of security both from a foundation level to an advanced level is essential.  The surprising thing is, that none of the topic areas in this essay are very complex, they are things that a person or organisation should be commonly doing. A business that is able to protect its data will almost certainly be able to focus on the business side of things and make money. Government departments will be able to keep data private and secure and military operations will not be hacked and released to other foreign malicious governments and terrorist organisations. This will keep our country safe and secure. </P>

 <div class="Asset Security">
    <h2><u>Asset Security</u></h2>
 <p> An asset is any data, device, or other component of the environment that supports information-related activities and is probably the most important thing that gives a business its value, this can also be something intangible like reputation, Intellectual property etc. Loss of an asset can cause a business to suffer financial, reputational or competitive losses. Securing assets becomes extremely when understanding that the asset is what gives the business its value. Too often organisations misunderstand the importance of an asset until it is too late and the damage has been done. </p>

     <h3><b>Managing Risk</b></h3>
     <p> When we talk about risk management in cyber security, we generally mean the evaluation of different risks together with procedures to minimise the impact and loss to the business. Risk can be managed in a number of ways, however, there is one main and common method of managing risk. Transferring of a risk to another e.g. insurance. The whole point of insurance is to lower the risk of loss (quite often financial) although recovering from a loss may take a while due to various processes. It can be quite costly to have insurance and so the right balance must be understood as to the value of the asset vs the cost of insuring that item. For example, a Cisco router costs £2000 the risk factor is possibly 2 x per year. However, the insurance costs £6000 per year. In this scenario it doesn’t make sense to insure this asset and you may decide to accept the risk associated with this asset. </p>
